That way we are able to systematically confirm that our assets are behaving in a way that we expect they should. Furthermore, previously written  tests should be retained in some centralized place (ideally a source controlled place) so that we can check if new developments break requirements from past developments.</p> <p>There are tools on the market that accomplish this goal very effectively (read 'dbt'), however, for many organizations, the road to implementing dbt is a long one. In the meantime, it didn't seem like an option to simply opt out of what is (luckily) becoming a fundamental best practice in the data world. </p> <p>While it may not be as convenient and quick as declaring tests in dbt, <code>sql-test-cli</code> is certainly is a big step in the right direction. </p>"},{"location":"docs/contributing/","title":"Contributing","text":""},{"location":"docs/contributing/#contributers-welcome","title":"Contributers Welcome!","text":"<p>Contribution from the any and all is welcomed and appreciated!
